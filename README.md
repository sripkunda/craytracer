# Code.org Ray Tracing Engine

A fully functional ray tracing engine made purely in Code.org. [Click here](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/eekiHImihlW8Y-ChgntsNZX_hkgY_z_FxHLXCLbuzo8) to view the project on Code.org. 

Because of the way Code.org executes programs, the engine is incredibly slow if run in the Code.org environment. For a much faster experience, you may follow these steps:

- View the code for the project and click `Remix` at the top left corner. This requires a Code.org account and will create a copy of this project on your account. 
- Click `Share > Show advanced options > Export for web` and select `Export`
- A zip file will be downloaded to your computer. Opening the zip file and opening the `index.html` file in your browser will allow you to access the most up-to-date GUI application. 

Alternatively, visiting [the github pages site for this project](https://sripkunda.github.io/craytracer) allows you to view the already exported Code.org files, although it is not necessarily up-to-date.
